2. COVID TRACKER: 

The covid 19 global data for the year 2020 is an often used dataset for developing a Tableau Dashboard, yet I used it to as I learnt a lot through the process. The data is downloaded from https://data.world/ as a CSV file.

Here's my blog post about it - https://abhinav14rd.wordpress.com/2023/10/31/my-first-tableau-dashboard/

I will keep updating this dashboard as I learn more about Tableau and the features it offers.
